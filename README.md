## 🧾 Project Description

This repository contains a comprehensive journey through **Machine Learning**, structured around three main pillars:

- **Supervised Learning**
- **Unsupervised Learning**
- **Mathematics for Machine Learning**

The project was built as part of Holberton School's intensive software engineering curriculum. It provides a hands-on approach to understanding the principles, algorithms, and mathematical foundations behind modern machine learning systems.

## 📚 Project Structure

### 🔹 Supervised Learning
Focuses on teaching models using labeled datasets to make predictions. It covers:
- Linear regression
- Logistic regression
- Decision trees
- Neural networks
- Evaluation metrics

### 🔹 Unsupervised Learning
Covers techniques where models learn patterns from data without explicit labels, such as:
- Clustering (K-means, Hierarchical)
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA)
- Anomaly detection

### 🔹 Math
Builds the necessary mathematical foundation for ML, including:
- Linear algebra (vectors, matrices)
- Probability and statistics
- Calculus and optimization

## 📖 Story Behind the Project

I developed this repository to deepen my understanding of how machines learn from data. The project grew over several weeks, with each section building upon the previous one. I aimed not only to solve exercises but also to write clean, reusable, and well-commented code that could be shared with others.

This project taught me how to think like a data scientist — breaking down problems, evaluating models, and continuously improving them based on data insights.
